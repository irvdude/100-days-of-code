# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 7th, 2024 


**Today's Progress**: Today we are just setting things up. I finally finished my NeoVim configuration after the 1004th reconfigure. (wont be the last) 

**Thoughts:** I will be completing some simple vanilla Javascript projects just to brush up on the basics.

### Day 1: February 8th, 2024 


**Today's Progress**: Pretty mich just copied the JS Fiddle from the project page, spent most of the time researching properties and elements that I didn't understand completely.

**Thoughts:** I left comments next to the lines of code that I understood the least to give context, eventually I will rebuild this project w/o guidance.
